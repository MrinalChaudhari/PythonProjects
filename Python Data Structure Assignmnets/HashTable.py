"""what is hash table?

It is also known as hash map is a data structure used to implement an associative array.It is a structure that can map keys to values."""
"""How it works?

A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the correct value can be found."""
"""In cases where I have a key for each element and I don't know the index of the element into an array, hashtables perform better than arrays (O(1) vs O(n)). The hash table search performs O(1) in the average case"""

""" Hash function creates the ASCII value for its key and stored the element in that ascii index."""
"""inear probing is a scheme in computer programming for resolving collisions in hash tables, data structures for maintaining a collection of keyâ€“value pairs and looking up the value associated with a given key"""
